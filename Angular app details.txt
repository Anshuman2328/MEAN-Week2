These are the steps to create An Angular APP from Scratch for StandAlone Angular APP:

1. naviagate to the location where you want to create the app. mkdir folder_name(for example mkdir demo)
2. navigate into the the demo, on the command line type "ng new public", this will create a public folder. 
3. navigate into the public folder, use ng serve to see if the angular is being served, used ng build --watch to continously 
serve the angular app. ( if you want to connect to your express app then inside the server.js of your express file 
paste this app.use(express.static( __dirname + '/public/dist/public' )); this will tell the express to look into the
public folder of the angular app for the rendering part. once this is done, when you navigate to the localhost:800(your 
express serving port) you should still see angular page being served up. 
4. while staying in the public folder, do "ng g s http". this will create two files under src - app folder
5. put following into the app.module.ts 

import { HttpService } from './http.service';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';


@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    HttpClientModule
  ],
  providers: [HttpService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }



6. put this in the app.component.ts


import { HttpService } from './http.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'Arturizmo - Oldest Living Pokemon';
  constructor(private _httpService: HttpService){}
}


7. put this into http.service.ts


import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';

@Injectable()
export class HttpService {

  constructor(private _http: HttpClient) {
  	this.getPokemon();
  	this.getAbility();
  }
  	getPokemon(){  " these methods are customized based on the required app"""
	  	let snorlax = this._http.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/143/');
	  	snorlax.subscribe((data: any) => 
		  	console.log(`Snorlax has an ability called ${data.abilities[2].ability.name}`, data));
  	}
  	getAbility(){
  		let immunity = this._http.get('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/ability/17/');
  		immunity.subscribe((data: any) =>
  			console.log(`${data.pokemon.length-1} others have this ability! ${data.pokemon[1].pokemon.name} and ${data.pokemon[2].pokemon.name}`, data));
  	}
}
